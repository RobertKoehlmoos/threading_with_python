"""
You need to calculate how many characters are in all of Shakespeare's sonnets.
Don't worry, another programmer lent us a folder containing all of his sonnets as separate text files.
This is the "sonnets" folder found
But, for speed we need you to use threading to parallelize the computation. Thus, you should
create one thread for each sonnet to check how many characters are in it, and then figure out how to sum all
those characters.

Return the number of characters in all the sonnets from the below function.
Hint: Don't be clever when checking how many characters there are in a file, just call len(f.read()).
